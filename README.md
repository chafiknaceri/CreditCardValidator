# Credit Card Validator

I have Created a Credit Card Validator using Pure C .

Basically the Program uses an Algorithm Called Luhn Algorithm .
The Software Takes in a Credit Card number of any type VISA,MASTERCARD,AMERICAN Express and 
returns Whether or not the Credit Card is Valid or Invalid But also What Card Exactly it is.
